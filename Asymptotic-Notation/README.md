# Asymptotic Notation
Asumptotic Notations helps to measure algorithms efficiency.
AN are the mathematical notations used to descrube the running time of an algorithm with certain input.

The study of change in performance of the algorithm with the change in the order of the input size is defined as asymptotic analysis.

There are mainly three asymptotic notations:
- Big-O notation
- Omega notation
- Theta notation
