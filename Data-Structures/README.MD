# Data Structures
## What is Data Structure?
A **data structure ia a storage that is used to store and organize data**. It is a way of arranging data on a computer so that it can be accessed and updated efficiently.<br>
Data structure is also **used for processing, retrieving and storing data.**<br>

- **Linear data structure:** Data structures where the data elements are organized sequentially, linearly.
    - **Static data structure:** Static data structure has a fixes memory sizes. Easier to access because it doesn't change.
    - **Dynamic data structure:** Dynamic data structure has no fixed memory size, which means that it can be reallocated in some random position during the runtime, which is more efficient.<br>
_For example_, we can store a list of items having the same data-type using the array data structure.<br>
- **Non-linear data structure:** Data structures where data elements are not placed sequentially or linearly. It's the opposite of the Linear data structure.<br>
