# Data Structures
## What is Data Structure?
A **data structure ia a storage that is used to store and organize data in memory**. It is a way of arranging data on a computer so that it can be accessed and updated efficiently.<br>
It is a set of algorithms that we can use in any programming language to structure the data in the memory.
The arrangement of data in a sequential manner is known as a linear data structure. The data structures used for this propose are _arrays_, _linked lists_, _stacks_ and _queues_, that type of data is called ADT (Abstract data type).
Data structure is also **used for processing, retrieving and storing data.**<br>

- **Linear data structure:** Data structures where the data elements are organized sequentially, linearly.
    - **Static data structure:** Static data structure has a fixes memory sizes. Easier to access because it doesn't change.
    - **Dynamic data structure:** Dynamic data structure has no fixed memory size, which means that it can be reallocated in some random position during the runtime, which is more efficient.<br>
_For example_, we can store a list of items having the same data-type using the array data structure.<br>
- **Non-linear data structure:** Data structures where data elements are not placed sequentially or linearly. It's the opposite of the Linear data structure.<br>

## Operations

The major or the common operations that can be performed on the data structures are:
- **Searching:** Search for any element in a data structure.
- **Sorting:** Sort the elements of a data structure either in an ascending or descending order.
- **Insertion:** Insert the new element in a data structure.
- **Updation:** Update the element, i.e., replacing the element with another element.
- **Deletion:** Perform the delete operation to remove the element from the data structure. 

## Advantages of Data Structures

- **Efficiency:** It makes the program very efficient in terms of time and space.
- **Reusability:** The data structure provides reusability means that multiple client programs can use the data structure.
- **Abstraction:** The data structure also provides high level of abstraction.
